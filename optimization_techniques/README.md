# **Project**: SVMs - Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) Implementation

# **Purpose**
This project aims to implement the Sequential Minimization Algorithm (SMO) for binary classification problems.

# **Concept**
The way that the SMO algorithm works is that it tries to solve the dual rather than the primal problem (SVM). For this, I will use the given bibliography (which is shown in the References area). In this project, I established three Parts as follows:
* Part A: Formulation of the algorithm.
* Part B: Implementation & Tuning.
* Part C: Performance.

# **Dataset**
The given dataset is the `gisette`. The dataset contains 7000 examples (6000 training - 1000 testing) with 5000 features in each one of them.
